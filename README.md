## Summary

From our summary statistics. We dont really see any major differences in temp, Which is a great thing! the average temp in june is about 74 degrees while in december the average temp is around 71. the max in june is 85 and in december is 83 which again is not really different. Having Hawaii keep a steady throughout the whole year lets us know were able to surf all year!! the only difference is maybe for our next analysis we can check which months bring in the most tourism for a more detailed explanation to see which months would bring us more profits.
